PI Control for Optimal Spectral Abscissa in General Non-Minimum Phase Systems with Time Delay

## Used functions:
To find the self-intersections of the curve we use intersections, provided by Doug Schwarz. On the Matlab File Exchange: https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11837-fast-and-robust-curve-intersections 
kpw and kiw give the corresponding stability crossing curve (kp, ki) for a given sigma
